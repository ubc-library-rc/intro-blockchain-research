### Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to establish foundational knowledge around blockchain technology, its originating communities and disciplines, and the types of research that can be conducted in this field. 

You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You may not feel totally confident in explaining these concepts in your own words just yet â€“ this is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any domain of knowledge, it will take continued exposure and learning to gain confidence in this nascent field.

This is your session. If you have a question or feel we are going too fast, please let the instructor know. We can decide as a group what to cover.
