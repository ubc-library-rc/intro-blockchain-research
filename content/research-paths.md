# The Multidisciplinarity of Blockchain Studies

First let's revisit and review the the originating disciplines which contribute to blockchain:

* Computer science and cryptography
* Complex systems engineering and design
* Archival and information science
* Economics and game theory

# Blockchain Communities as Subcultures

* This fast-paced, small-scale set of intertwining communities provides a veritable live lab for the many disciplines tied into cryptoeconomics
* Keep in mind that their participants are *real people* just as much at risk of harm or exploitation as any other population you'd study
* In each exemplar use case to follow, we'll touch more upon the particular risks and pain points that arise when researching, or even engaging, with the communities around disruptive technologies like blockchain
