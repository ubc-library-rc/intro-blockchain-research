# Research Use Case: Community Research (STS)

**Primary Focus**: How do communities around emerging technologies behave?

**Proximal Disciplines**: Sociology, Anthrolopology, Cultural Theory, Psychology, Science and Technology Studies

**Example Research Questions**:

* How do cryptocurrency users conceptualize the notion of 'trust'?
* What are the major ideological divides between Bitcoiners and Ethereans?
* What attitude do Bitcoin early adopters express about the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency by centralized banks?

**Major Concepts in Play**: [Trustlessness](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless), [Decentralists](https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede), [Cypherpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), ['Toxic Maximalism'](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/op-ed-why-bitcoins-toxic-maximalism-makes-sense)

**Risks to Consider**:

* Highest risk of personal harm to research subjects (individualized focus)
* Difficult to gain trust/'insider status' in these communities
* Quickly changing culture is hard for academic research cycles to keep up with

**Example Project**: [Artemij Voskobojnikov's UBC-based research](https://lersse.ece.ubc.ca/2020/03/03/lersse-at-financial-cryptography-2020/) in this space, on the conceptualizations and self-perceptions of different "generations" of cryptocurrency market entrants


# Research Use Case: Law and Public Policy

**Primary Focus**: How do we adjust law and policy to best fit these new technologies?

**Proximal Disciplines**: Law, Public Policy, Accounting, Economics, History, Sociology

**Example Research Questions**:

* Do blockchain developers hold [fiduciary responsibility](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3203198)?
* Should cryptocurrency be regulated as a currency, an asset, a security, or something elsea?

**Major Concepts in Play**: [Sovereignty](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-unleashes-the-sovereign-individual), [Governance](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/byzantine-generalization-problem/), [Permissionlessness](https://www.corda.net/blog/permissionlessness-a-simple-concept-with-profound-implications/), [Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

**Risks to Consider**:

* Can be challenging to map slow-moving law and policy sectors to the "move fast and break things" speed of disruptive technology
* Participants in this ecosystem are often inherently suspicious of law and policy collaborators

**Example Project**: This [recent Open Access paper](https://jbba.scholasticahq.com/article/13164.pdf) analyzes and lays out the potential requirements for Non-Fungible Tokens utilized in relation to a genomic data platform to meet the privacy standards of the GDPR and California's Consumer Privacy Act.


# Research Use Case: Advocacy and Ethics

**Primary Focus**: How can we prevent the potential exploitation of these technologies to control, track, or otherwise harm populations?

**Proximal Disciplines**: Public Policy, Social Work, Philosophy, Non-Profit Management, Humanities

**Example Research Questions**:

* What are the mechanisms for transparency and accountability amongst the major public blockchains?
* What grounding principles should smart contract developers keep in mind when writing self-executing code?

**Major Concepts in Play**: [Game Theory](https://ncase.me/trust/), [Governance](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/byzantine-generalization-problem/), [Trustlessness](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/what-do-we-mean-by-blockchains-are-trustless)

**Risks to Consider**:

* Difficult to identify what is "the path of least harm," especially when you are new to these complex intersecting domains
* As someone deeply engaged in this facet of research myself: it runs the highest risk of ending up in vain :/
