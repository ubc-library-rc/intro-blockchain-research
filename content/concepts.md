# Contextualizing Cryptoeconomics

![Cryptoeconomics 1](figures/crypto-1.png)
<br>

* Defining [cryptoeconomics](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cryptoeconomics)

* Key concepts: **append-only** (*immutable*), **peer to peer** (*verifiable*), **uncensorable** (*self-sovereign*)

* Why use such a "ten-dollar word"?

* Concrete elements: reviewing the practical 'toolkit' derived from the whitepaper

# Game Theory Makes This Awesome

* True complexity comes from the unpredictable decisions of human beings at scale

* Economics' historical attempt to grapple with this "irrationality"

* *Crypto*economics, with its programmatic elements, allows us greater range of precise experimentation

# Navigating/Evaluating Online Resources

<br>

* Of course, you need the same digital literacy and critical evaluation skills that you use everyday as a student or researcher

* In addition, you should embrace some core maxims from this industry: "Do Your Own Research" and "Don't Trust, Verify"

* *How* to verify? Look for major sources ([Andreas Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/) is one of the original and the best) and voices to start following. That doesn't mean trust everything they say, of course, but start to curate the sources that make sense to you!

# Curated Resources to Get Started

Before diving into blockchain-specific resources, I'll share the best 'game theory' orientation I've ever found- [Nicky Case's ~30 min game 'The Evolution of Trust'](https://ncase.me/trust/).

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has the most 'established' sets of curated resources.

The [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page) was created in 2010. It's not updated a *ton* but it's a great starting point for all of the basics, especially very bite-sized core technical concepts.

[Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) is a much more all-encompassing site for exploration, and he maintains it as somewhat of a community project with additional resources frequently suggested through [the project's Github repository](https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/tree/master/bitcoin-information).

For Ethereum, [the project's home site learning section](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a great place to start exploring.

From there, [ETHhub](https://docs.ethhub.io/) curates extensive learning resources from the community, and the [ethresear.ch forum](https://ethresear.ch/) presents deeper dives in the fringe of active research and development.

Ultimately, most projects *beyond* these two widely adopted public blockchains will present you their own "self-contained" resources and learning path (an indicator that, at this stage, many of them are still very *centralized*). As Bitcoin and Ethereum have a much broader surface of commentary and content production, I thought it would be most useful to provide specific curation regarding these blockchains. 

# 'DYOR' - Maintain Vigilance!

* This field overlaps with information security and 'hacking' along its many shades (e.g. white, gray, black hat hacking)

* Never provide your personal information to someone else, or "send someone cryptocurrency to receive more back." Anything that looks too good to be true, *definitely is*.

* "Social engineering" is one of the greatest attack vectors in this industry- e.g. make sure you bookmark links that you return to regularly, rather than using a search engine to track them down, as that can be temporarily "gamed" by scammers
