# Contextualizing Cryptoeconomics

![Cryptoeconomics 1](figures/crypto-1.png)
<br>

* Defining [cryptoeconomics](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cryptoeconomics)

* Key concepts: 
    * **append-only** (*immutable*)
    * **peer to peer** (*verifiable*
    * **uncensorable** (*self-sovereign*)

Brings in elements of:

* Computer science and cryptography
* Complex distributed systems engineering
* Archival and information science
* Economics and game theory

# Navigating/Evaluating Online Resources

<br>

* Of course, you need the same digital literacy and critical evaluation skills that you use everyday as a student or researcher

* In addition, you should embrace some core maxims from this industry: "Do Your Own Research" and "Don't Trust, Verify"

* *How* to verify? Look for major sources ([Andreas Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/) is one of the original and the best) and voices to start following. That doesn't mean trust everything they say, of course, but start to curate the sources that make sense to you!

Before diving into blockchain-specific resources, I'll share the best 'game theory' orientation I've ever found- [Nicky Case's ~30 min game 'The Evolution of Trust'](https://ncase.me/trust/).


### Bitcoin Resources 

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has the most 'established' sets of curated resources.

The [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page) was created in 2010. It's not updated a *ton* but it's a great starting point for all of the basics, especially very bite-sized core technical concepts.

[Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Resources](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) is a much more all-encompassing site for exploration, and he maintains it as somewhat of a community project with additional resources frequently suggested through [the project's Github repository](https://github.com/jlopp/lopp.net/tree/master/bitcoin-information).

### Ethereum Resources

For Ethereum, [the project's home site learning section](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a great place to start exploring.

From there, [ETHhub](https://docs.ethhub.io/) curates extensive learning resources from the community, and the [ethresear.ch forum](https://ethresear.ch/) presents deeper dives in the fringe of active research and development.

Ultimately, most projects *beyond* these two widely adopted public blockchains will present you their own "self-contained" resources and learning path (an indicator that, at this stage, many of them are still very *centralized*). As Bitcoin and Ethereum have a much broader surface of commentary and content production, I thought it would be most useful to provide specific curation regarding these blockchains.
