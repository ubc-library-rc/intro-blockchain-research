* Key concepts: **append-only** (*immutable*), **peer to peer** (*verifiable*), **uncensorable** (*self-sovereign*)

* "Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks" - the [Genesis Block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) of Bitcoin

* Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper: bringing together the toolkit for cryptoeconomics

    * Chain of immutable, timestamped data blocks which build upon one another (*timechain*)
    * Competitive use of computing power (*Proof of Work*)
    * An [antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Introduction) system (e.g. [resistant to Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack))

* The snowball effect of community adoption: inventing value "out of thin air" (e.g. Laszlo Hanyecz's [Bitcoin Pizza](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-10-years-laszlo-hanyecz))
