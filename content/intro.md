# What Do We Mean By Blockchain?

![Intro 1](figures/intro-1.png)
<br>

* At its base, "[blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain)" simply refers to a type of data structure which is *simple for anyone to verify* and *difficult for anyone to change*.

* Usually, when people *say* blockchain, they're referring more generally to the ledgers, cryptocurrencies, or decentralized consensus mechanisms being used in blockchain systems.

# Origins: The 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper

![Intro 2](figures/intro-2.png)
<br>

**[Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)**: launching the toolkit for cryptoeconomics

 * A chain of immutable, timestamped data blocks which build upon one another (*timechain*)
 * Use of [competitive computing power](https://medium.com/certik/how-bitcoin-works-mining-and-consensus-3d64bf893ba2) (*Proof of Work*) to secure the network (many computers across the world confirm transactions, rather than a centralized authority)
 * An [antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Introduction) distributed consensus-based network system (e.g. [resistant to Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack))

In Fall 2020, we made this set of [short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvhhoxakT2WAKm6WKFEf3iPQWGAjl8QYR) explaining each section of the Bitcoin whitepaper in ~5 min or less.

# Bitcoin: A Success Story, Slow Then Fast

![Intro 3](figures/intro-3.png)
<br>

* The snowball effect of community adoption: inventing value "out of thin air" (e.g. Laszlo Hanyecz's [Bitcoin Pizza](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-10-years-laszlo-hanyecz))

* After Bitcoin adoption began to pick up, *people wanted to copy its success*:  this led to the age of ["altcoins"](https://hackernoon.com/about-bitcoin-what-altcoins-and-shitcoins-dont-seem-to-get-rs53323w) (which began by simply *forking* Bitcoin, or copying its codebase)

* Excited developers wanted to see peer-to-peer technology go beyond *money* - the next major movements came with the creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)

# What About "Decentralization"?

[Why Decentralization Matters](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e): 'Coding In' decentralization as an attempt to reclaim the promise of the open World Wide Web (e.g. [Decentralized Web Summit](https://www.decentralizedweb.net/about/))
