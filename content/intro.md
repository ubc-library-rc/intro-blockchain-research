# What Do We Mean By Blockchain?

![Intro 1](figures/intro-1.png)
<br>

### At its base, "[blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain)" simply refers to a type of data structure which is *simple for anyone to verify* and *difficult for anyone to change*.

Usually, when people *say* blockchain, they're referring more generally to the **ledgers**, **cryptocurrencies**, or **decentralized consensus mechanisms** which serve as components in the systems around blockchain structures.

### Please navigate with me to the original [Bitcoin.it Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain) to review their description of blockchain data structures.

# Origins: The 2008 Bitcoin Whitepaper

### **[Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** launched the toolkit for cryptoeconomics, and should be read by everyone who is serious about participating in, or studying, the blockchain field.

The innovations it interweaves include:
 * A chain of immutable, timestamped data blocks which build upon one another (*timechain*)
 * Use of [competitive computing power](https://medium.com/certik/how-bitcoin-works-mining-and-consensus-3d64bf893ba2) (*Proof of Work*) to secure the network (in which many computers across the world confirm transactions, rather than a centralized authority)
 * An [antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Introduction) distributed consensus-based network system (e.g. [resistant to Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack))

In Fall 2020, UBC Bitcoin Club and Carpe Lunam Events created this set of [short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvhhoxakT2WAKm6WKFEf3iPQWGAjl8QYR) explaining each section of the Bitcoin whitepaper in ~5 min or less. 

For now, it's useful to understand that Bitcoin borrows from:

* the field of **cryptography** to ensure network security and pseudonymity 

Taken all together, this original technical paper presents all the components necessary for Bitcoin's multidisciplinary foundations and eventual global success story.

# Bitcoin's Success Story: Slow Then Fast

<br>

### The snowball effect of community adoption: bitcoin helped people besides economists recognize that value is largely a matter of belief. 

Early adopters had to demonstrate their belief in this "magical internet money's" value in order for others to begin to place value in it (e.g. Laszlo Hanyecz's [Bitcoin Pizza](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-10-years-laszlo-hanyecz)).

### After Bitcoin adoption began to pick up, *people wanted to copy its success*:  this led to the age of ["altcoins"](https://hackernoon.com/about-bitcoin-what-altcoins-and-shitcoins-dont-seem-to-get-rs53323w).

This trend began with simply *forking* Bitcoin, or copying its codebase, then making changes or attempting to add new features.

### Excited developers wanted to see peer-to-peer technology go beyond *money* - the next major movements came with the creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/).
